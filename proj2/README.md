# 🏃‍♂️ BrickYard Bites (Name WIP)

> CSC510: Software Engineering, Fall 2025  
> **Team 5:** Anmol Koul · Arnav Mejari · Om Kumar Singh · Shweta Patki  

BrickYard Bites is a campus-oriented, student-run alternative to Grubhub.  
Students already getting food from on-campus spots can **broadcast** their run so others can **attach** orders to it — saving time, cost, and reducing delivery load.

## 🧩 Scripts

| Command | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start local development server |
| `npm run build` | Build production bundle |
| `npm run preview` | Preview production build |
| `npm run test` | Run all unit tests (Vitest) |

## 🧪 Testing (coming soon)
Once testing is set up:
```bash
npm run test
```
> We’ll use **Vitest + React Testing Library** for component and route testing.

## 🎨 Styling (Tailwind to be added later)
We will integrate **TailwindCSS** in a later milestone (Week 4).  
Current layout uses basic inline styles to keep things simple during development.
